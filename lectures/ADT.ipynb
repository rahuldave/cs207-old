    "Data Structures, when viewed in terms of their storage: is it an array, or linked list, or dynamic array; are concrete implementations. But when viewed in terms of what they can do, or the operations they support can be viewed as Abstract Data Types (ADTs). \n",
    "\n",
    "A stack can be thought of from the perspective of its operations: push, pop, and peek. The O(n) these give us depend upon the concrete underlying representation: a python list may be, or our linked list class. Appending (pushing) at the front of LL is O(1). So is popping, peeking. If you used the front of the list its O(n)..in Python its better to use the back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the operations supported on the stack are a subset, or even a facade over operations on the list or linked list (its possible we might need to put multiple manipulations together). In this sense, the stack is better developed as a new class, with any implementation specifics of the underlying data structures hidden away.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you dont do this, you are **evil**. You have **exposed** your **Representation**. Dont do it. Some tricks to achieve this are to make explicit copies of containers or iterators on the way in or out, and to only expose methods that are facades over the methods of underlying storage. Additionally, use single underscores or double underscores for internal stuff...python will even mangle names starting with two underscores for you (the client can still get at themethods but then does so at their own peril)."

    "- set of values, creatable/destroyable, manipulatable, and observable\n",
    "- only by an API\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we specify an ADT? We can do it in the informal way we have done so far: the concept of a sequence, or something thats iterable. But this could be thought of as too abstract a definition. It may help to tell us that a stack is a sequence, but does not help us define a stack ADT formally. There is nothing to stop us doing this informally though and communicating it via documentation. Indeed this is what we mostly do in documenting APIs for clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we could also (mis?)use inheritance for this by creating a base class and having implementations inherit from this. But these **interfaces** are important enough that languages provide support to make them explicit and verifiable. Java for example has *interfaces*, Smalltalk and Objective-C have protocols. In C++ the STL provides data-type agnostic stacks, vectors, etc as well with well defined interfaces and implementations under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides us this whole gamut of possibilities as well, from the dynamic, just-documented protocols characteristic of duck typing, to Abstract Base Classes (ABC's) which make the interface explicit, and verifiable to boot.\n",

    "\n",
    "How does this work?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Firstly note that even without ABCs, a class has an interface defined by its publicly accessible attributes (methods or data). This also includes dunder methods; while these are NOT publicly accessible, they control the external behavior on functions like `len` and `iter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Secondly we can use ABC's to define such protocols, and then mix-in into a class multiple such protocols to give the class its aggregated behavior. We shall see this use of mixins soon. Thus for example a class can be a sequence as well as an iterable.\n",

It’s usually not OK to have a chain of if/elif/elif with insinstance checks performing different actions depending on the type of an object: you should be using polymorphism for that—i.e., designing your classes so that the interpreter dispatches calls to the proper methods\n",
    "\n",
    ">On the other hand, it’s usually OK to perform an insinstance check against an ABC if you must enforce an API contract: “Dude, you have to implement this if you want to call me,” as technical reviewer Lennart Regebro put it. That’s particularly useful in sys‐ tems that have a plug-in architecture. Outside of frameworks, duck typing is often sim‐ pler and more flexible than type checks.\n",

    "## Modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind refactoring is to make sure we have no repeated code, everything is readable and testable, and most importantly, you have made it easier for future you. The usual direction this modularity goes in is to have many small classes and functions with loose coupling between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the pros and cons to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- small classes/modules mean interfaces with only few abstract procedures.\n",
    "- thid means simple specs for interfaces\n",
    "- this also means invariants are local. What is this? For the many functions part of modularity we can judge and test what a function does independent of the other functions. Now, with AbsFun and RepInv, we can do the same for ADT.\n",
    "- Notice that this makes writing pre-and post-conditions harder. If you remember out binary search implementation we could have modularized it further, but communicating the pre-and-post conditions would have got harder with greater modularity. Still, remember how complex our binary-search spec was?.\n",
    "- the correctness is now easier to reason about and test on a per function and per-method basis\n",
    "- but we are less performant because we have many additional function calls. Also since everything is not at one place, its harder to play optimization tricks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**You must exercise your own judgement** as to where you want to make this tradeoff between loose coupling/modularity and tight coupling/performance. As scientists, we are often exposed to the latter: a performant array for example precludes all sorts of nice streaming algorithms, duplicates memory, etc and makes things more monolithic. But where it is an advantage to ease of programming, it behooves us to choose narrow and nice interfaces. We'll see an example of this next time.\n"

    "## Back to ABCs\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we \"registered\" SimpleSet1 with the SimpleSetInterface ADT, and found that even without ANY explicit inheritance, SimpleSet1 was found to be a subclass of SimpleSet. This is very useful in python since Python supports multiple-inheritance, and we can thus \"mixin\" different protocols into what we do.\n",
    "\n",
    "On such registration, Python will just believe us without checking that we implement all the abstract methods. If we dont, we will gwt runtime exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you remember the `Answer` class from abovr which was a subclass of Sized? That wasnt even registered!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because `abc.Sized` implements a class method  `__subclasshook__`., which had this implementation...\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def __subclasshook__(cls, C):\n",
    "        if cls is Sized:\n",
    "            if any(\"__len__\" in B.__dict__ for B in C.__mro__):\n",
    "                return True\n",
    "        return NotImplemented\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This says, when you call `issubclass`, the class in question, C, check if any of its parents has a `__len__` in them, and if they do, C is a subclass. This is precisely what happens here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in-fact, the ad-hoc protocols we have been talking about in python actually do have a formal counterpart, even tho no inheritance is actually going on. What is the use of this?\n",
    "        \n",
    "Unless you are a framework creator, dont. Indeed even SimpleSetInterface did not have to be an ABC, it could have been simply documentation. But the ideas of interface and implementation separation are super important, so whatever method you want to use to document you interface is better than none, even if it is declaring an ABC."
